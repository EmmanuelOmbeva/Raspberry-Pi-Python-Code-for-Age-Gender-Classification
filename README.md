# Facial Age and Gender Detection

This Python software uses OpenCV to detect faces in real time and classify ages and genders in video streams. It highlights recognized faces with green rectangles and shows the expected age and gender. The script runs until the user exits by pressing 'q', at which point it cleans up the resources.

## Setup instructions
1. Install Python and OpenCV.
2. Download the appropriate model files.
3. Start the script with a webcam connected.

## Dependencies: - Python - OpenCV

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. To depart, press 'q'.

## Files - 'face_age_gender_detection.py' is the main script file. - Model files for facial recognition, age, and gender classification.

## Credits.
This script is based on OpenCV tutorials and models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification.

Feel free to explore and change the code for your own projects!
